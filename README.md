# Hello!

My name is Guilherme Vida Larga and I'm a software and game developer. I created this page to showcase the projects I have worked on!

## Planet Aid

</p>
  
<p align="justify"><strong>Planet Aid</strong> was the first game I worked on and it was developen in XNA, which is no longer supported. The game is similar to the Angry Birds formula where the player would have to launch a flask, controlling its force and direction, reaching the end goal. Maps are composed by different planets that would serve as both an obstacle and as a gravitational force that would change the trajectory of the flask.</p>

<p align="justify">
  
This project was done by 3 students in the first semester of university and my role was to programme the game physics and design the levels.

## Space Directive

<p align="justify"> <strong>Space Directive</strong> is a traditional arcade space shooter where the player has the option to design their own levels and play them.
  
</p>

<p align="justify">
  
It was developed for Windows and Android allowing for players to save their accounts and transfer them to the different devices, keeping track of their data.

</p>

<p align="justify">

This project was made by a team of 3 students on Unity. I was a Programmer for the project and implemented the game physics, such as collision detection, movement, shooting and designed and programmed the patterns of the final bosses.

## Dimensional Adventure

<p align="justify"> <strong>Dimensional Adventure</strong> is a plaftormer made by 2 students using Unity. It uses both 2D and 3D environments. The player controls 2 characters at the same time using the same commands. One lives in a 2D world while the other lives in a 3D world. The player has to avoid obstacles and solve puzzles using both characters to interact between eachother.

<p align="justify">

Puzzles include pressing a switch in the 3D world to open a door in the 2D world and shrinking the 2D character by moving the 3D character away fomm the screen (farther). I was involved in desgning the levels and puzzles as well as programming the synched movement of both characters and platforming.

## AR Runner

<p align="justify"> <strong>AR Runner</strong> is a mobile game developed for Android that uses Augmented Reality. The player can play it anywhere with a flat surface. Similar to mobile "Runner" games, the player will have to dodge the obstacles in its way, while trying to collect coins for a better score.
  
</p>

</p>

<p align="justify"> It was developed by myself in Unity using Vuforia for the Augmented Reality. Moving left and right the player will have to dodge the barrels coming their way that are spawning and moving increasingly faster.

## Car Matches

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="justify"> <strong>Car Matches</strong> is a multiplayer game developed in Unreal Engine by myself. Much like Rocket League the player will have to score a goal against their opponent while driving their cars. 

</p>

<p align="justify"> The emphasis of this project wasn't the game itself but the multiplayer aspect. I managed to create a network using both peer to peer and client/server architectures where 2 players can connect and play together.

## Puyo Puyo

<p align="center">

</p>

This project consists of a PuyoPuyo game developed from scratch in C++ using the SDL framework. It is my recent work and the first game I developed outside of work and after graduating. It behaves exactly as a game of Puyo Puyo should.
